# Wishlist App

The Family Wishlist App is an app that allows family members to create and share a wishlist of gift ideas. Each family member can save gift ideas to the wishlist, and other family members can mark them as purchased to avoid duplicate gifts.

## Features

The app includes the following features:

- User authentication: Each family member can create an account and log in to access their wishlist.
- Wishlist creation: Each family member can add items to their wishlist, including a name, description, and link to the item if applicable.
- Wishlist sharing: Family members can share their wishlist with other family members by adding them to their "wishlist group".
- Purchased item tracking: When a family member purchases an item from the wishlist, they can mark it as "purchased" so that other family members know not to purchase the same item.
